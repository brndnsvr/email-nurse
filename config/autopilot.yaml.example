    Handle my email according to these preferences:

    ## Priority & Importance
    - Emails from my team (@mycompany.com): leave in inbox, high priority
    - Emails from my manager: leave in inbox, flag for attention
    - Emails where I'm CC'd but not TO: lower priority, can be archived

    ## Newsletters & Marketing
    - Tech newsletters I've subscribed to: archive to "Reading List"
    - Marketing/promotional I didn't ask for: delete
    - Daily/weekly digest emails: archive, mark as read

    ## Notifications
    - GitHub notifications: move to "GitHub" folder, mark as read
    - GitHub @mentions or review requests: leave in inbox, flag
    - CI/CD failures: leave in inbox, flag
    - Calendar invites: leave in inbox

    ## Transactional
    - Order confirmations: move to "Receipts" folder
    - Shipping updates: move to "Receipts" folder
    - Password resets: leave in inbox (never auto-process these)

    ## Auto-Reply Guidelines
    - Only suggest replies for work emails requiring acknowledgment
